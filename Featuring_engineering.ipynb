        "\n",
        "   A parameter is a variable inside a machine learning model that is learned from the training data. Parameters control the behavior of the model and help it make predictions. For example, in a linear regression model, slope and intercept are parameters. These values are adjusted during training to minimize the error between predicted and actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is correlation?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Correlation is a statistical measure that shows the relationship between two variables. It tells us how strongly variables are related and in which direction. The value of correlation ranges from -1 to +1, where +1 indicates strong positive correlation, -1 indicates strong negative correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Negative correlation means that when one variable increases, the other variable decreases. For example, as the number of hours spent watching TV increases, academic performance may decrease. A negative correlation value lies between 0 and -1.\n",

        "4. Define Machine Learning.\n",
        "\n",
